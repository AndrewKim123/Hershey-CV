    <h2>Dear Hershey,</h2>
    <p>I am writing to apply for the internship opportunity in creative marketing at Hershey's. As a creative and motivated individual with a passion for marketing, I am excited about the opportunity to join your team and contribute my skills and experience to the company's mission.</p>
    <p>One of my greatest strengths is my experience with Adobe Premiere Pro. I started using the software as a hobby, and have since developed a strong ability to create engaging video content. In addition to my video editing skills, I am also skilled at creating social media content and producing great video edits. I believe that my skills in these areas would be a valuable asset to the creative marketing team at Hershey's.</p>
    <p>I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong fit for this internship at Hershey's. I am highly motivated and eager to take on new challenges and learn new skills. I am excited about the opportunity to discuss this internship further and look forward to the chance to contribute to the success of Hershey's.</p>
    <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to join your team and contribute to the success of Hershey's.</p>
